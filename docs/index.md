# MKVrestyle

A command-line utility for basic restyling of an embedded ASS file with a new user-defined font and styling.

!!! note
    
    This utility is meant to add styling for unstyled ASS subtitles and is not meant as a replacement for properly working functionality like [Aegisub Resolution Resampler](https://aegisub.org/docs/latest/resolution_resampler/).

!!! warning
    
    Resampling works for the main dialogue font, but lines containing tags for inline styling (e.g. `fn`, `fs`) might appear broken after resampling! You have been warned.
